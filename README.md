# Hello-World
This is my first repository. I'm just learning how to use Github and my repositories.
Hello, my name is Anirban Chand. I'm a student of Computer Science and Technology in IIEST, Shibpur. 
During the lockdown period in India I learnt actually some very good habits and Consistency is one of them.
I was very much bad at consistency, but around 2 months ago I joined Network Marketing, and the fact is it teaches me hell lot of things.
  1. Be confident 
  2. Be stubborn
  3. Be straightforward
  4. Never ever judge any people by their age or race or anything else
  5. Believe in yourself
  6. Never loose hope
  7. Be positive - don't be with negative peoples
  8. How to communicate with unknown peoples
  9. How to build relationships with others
  10. Be consistent
This was my 2 months journey in this marketing field, everyone can join this and can have some major changes in themselves.
